# Troškomjer
Troskomjer is a smart receipt management and financial analytics app. Users can scan receipts using PaddleOCR, which are then stored in the app. Troskomjer helps analyze spending habits, track expenses, and even find the lowest prices of products based on submitted receipts, including when and where those prices were recorded.

The backend is built with FastAPI, PaddleOCR, PostgreSQL, Alembic, and hey-api/openapi-ts for generating frontend types and services. The frontend uses React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, TanStack Table, Zod, and Sonner for a fast, type-safe, and modern UI experience.
